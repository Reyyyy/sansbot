# Sans, The Undertale Bot



Sans is an undertale bot designed to be sort of like the actual Sans. His only commands are listed below. He is, of course, still in development. However, I add new commands to him almost every day. You can use his `s!suggest` command to suggest some, aswell!

You can add the bot **[Here](https://tinyurl.com/addsansbot)**

## A Discordia Bot!

Sans is coded in the language of Lua, from the [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia/wiki) Depository! Though this may be the case, he is still a top notch bot and performs quite well!


## Commands
### Here are some of Sans' many commands!

**s!info** -- Bot Information

**s!help** -- Shows the help menu.

**s!pun** -- Sends one of many very bad skeleton puns.

**s!ping** -- Pong!

**s!suggest** -- Suggest something for the bot. Sends a message to a private server where the owner reviews it.
